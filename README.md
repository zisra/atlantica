# Atlantica

Unopinionated JavaScript HTTP client

## Motivation

I built this package because I did not find one that met the following criteria:

-   Extremely unopinionated; minimum assumuptions
-   Chainable methods
-   Return data only
-   Lightweight
-   Easy-to-use methods

## Installation

```shell
npm install atlantica
yarn add atlantica
pnpm add datlantica
```

## Usage

> The following functions should be in an async context

The package returns a function by default

```js
import atlantica from 'atlanica';
```

**TODO: More docs will be added later**
